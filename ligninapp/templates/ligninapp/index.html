    Emboldened by <a href="https://cscroucher.shinyapps.io/LoCoMoTeDashboard/">Charlotte Croucher's PhD thesis "LoCoMoTe Dashboard",</a>
    I <a href="markromanmiller.com">(Mark)</a> hacked together a couple more features on an earlier prototype of this lit review tool. I hope you enjoy it!
</p>

<p>Currently, everthing is public, but features will be added soon. You can contribute - email me if you're interested at mmiller30 at iit dot edu.</p>

<h3>Pitch (Informal)</h3>

<p>
    Literature reviews are great, but they show the literature at one point in time. It doesn't need to be static anymore,
    because we have alternative publishing methods now. So, why don't we pool all the informal, ad-hoc spreadsheets
    we have from our old literature review sections - and plug your own papers on these tables, too!
</p>

<h3>Pitch (Formal)</h3>
<p>
    Research builds upon the already-known to reach the not-yet-known. Delineating between the two often takes the
    form of an ad-hoc taxonomy of related work created for the specific paper submission, with some
    criteria drawn based upon previous literature and some criteria drawn using new distinctions
    that the authors contribute to the literature. Defining this space implied by several works
    is often the contribution of literature review papers and SoKs. However, these reviews are
    static, limiting their usefulness in fast-moving areas. I propose that a dynamic, updating
    literature review that supports the development of ad-hoc taxonomies can help individual researchers
    find and sort related work quickly as well as provide shared ground for other researchers to
    assert or correct these same ideas.
